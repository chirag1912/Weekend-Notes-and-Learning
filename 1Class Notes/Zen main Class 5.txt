Hey,

Hey, so CORS is blocking the website of cross domain;

Using CORS allows this,
ie S3 bucket of guvi;

So, see what are other diomains as blocked by the 

CORS is like name check;
proxy is like bug;

Proxy is just asking;
Give it to me;


CORS for website to website communication;

REST API:
Hey, get the api from different Domain, website;
data of the company;

parse the data sepaarte using comma;

Hey MS came with SOAP structure:
using XML; thing with braces for each element;

then just using the list;

Use the web format; to access the data;
which are:
http, resources everything, stateless;
url;

Google used this rest.api;

Rest Started using JSON also; Douglas Crockford;
The better parts;//video;


Client using: MEN system where FE and BE JS;

As in JS, everything is object format; so started JSON;

No extra lib needed as needed in case to read XML;

Data was lighter;

New domain regis: www.json.org;

Parsing takes less time;

SOAP uses wsdl file;//can be used using Wireshark

What is the library: 

Using JSON.stingify or JSON.parse();

Hey,

Error Handling:
CORS implementation in BE node.js;

How to handle the error:
By using Try catch block;

use log()//to send the error to server;

preventive handling: by checking if!=NULL;

reactive try catch;

no multiple catch in JS;

See when do different type of errors happen;

Do, JSON TAsk;
GO and handle the errors, in CORS;

Scope:

The function scope variable var goes till there;
Global only when dec outside the function;

Always use let;
Var hoisting happens only till function level if onside the function;

Hey, so 

Only the variable is hoisted not their values;

JS: 
Best Optimal Solution:

When you understand the cod ethat is a good developer;

Get attached to the problem not the language coding;

Certaing languages are needed for different puposes;
That has to be used that way;

Why using this prog language for this technoology should be the question.

For ML we use python as many libraries are there;

Work faster no mem cnstraint: PHP is used;

So properties are also not hoisted;

If anything is not defined in let or var it will become a property of window;

And then it is a global functio by itself;

Always use let;

const is not hoisted;

that will become a global property without decl a variabe;

Window is an object a will, a.window is then the property;

is available only for browsers;

Object comaprison:
a==a1 will be false;
a===a1 also false then;

So, the object is using some kind of hashing before storing the object;


Functions:

hi, -10, hi, 30, 30

everytime return comes the rest function will never get performed;

Hey, so
when calling the function they supersede the default value of the function;

Hey, so:
m1=f1(11);
that is when the new value is being set for the function;

Homework:
What is the difference between window, screen, and document in Javascript?
JSON task

Find the fix – for the error slide

Also, about: 
variable is pass by value,
and Object is pass by Reference;
