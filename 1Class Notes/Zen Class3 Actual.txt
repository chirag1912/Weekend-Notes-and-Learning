UDP: Fire and forget;
TCP/IP: is a physical hanshake and line is established;

DOM is HTML representation;

Username and Password has to be in HTTPS;

Rest API's:
https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all

This API gives me JSON in a beautiful format;

So, how to do this JSON Object:
So, it is: JavaScript Object Notation;

Is the JSON;


//Hey MOst haven't submitted their assignments;

Ask your mentors for the points you have from the Guvi Mentor;

Browser and Rendering Engine is same they say;
as single component;
Browser Creates DOM Tree;
Rendering paints DOM tree to the browser;

Entrire thing is called Layout Thing;

HYML_DOM_then Rendering GUy;

How TCP handles how many times we want to download?
There is Buffer for each server they can Answer only those many TCP Requests;

Then Queue- which also has a Limit as well;

Ok, so opening Network in Guvi Site:
AnyRequest-> there is waiting time involved;

So, any icon will has waiting time, according to the browser rendering engine when it paints;
Any request there will be a waiting and requesting flow;

Layered and Rendering Engine are the same.

ISP: how they fetch the IP address and how they lookup in Cache?

PostMan Slide:
Default Value of Browser is GET;

API: is something which gives some data;

So, API.countries is an array of JSON;
//will be working on this data from now on;

1. We will get the data and parse it.
2. Will use Postman to get and POst this data;
3. Will Use JSON Server with default data;
4. Will host this in Heroku;
5. Will do AJAX;
6. HTML CLasses; we get and display the data;


Response Header in JS Page need to Understand:
Allow Access Control Origin //See what is this?
Maybe allow in this countreis only/-
Like CORS stuff;

Get the raw data and do in JS File;

Any JS Code will only be available in the Console of the Browser not on the main page of the website;

In this API the Method header is Get;
 So we are getting this info in COnsole of the brwoser;
(which is default of the browser); 

Only way to Postthe method in the browser is by writing code;

and pushing it;

Is a substitute for the browser all the Array entries come;

POST will be used; after

YOu can send Key, Value pair and send as well by POsting;

Can be used in API testig by sending data to the API and chceking what is returned;		//BACKEND DEVELOPERS


CURL alternative; REST Client Extension also there;

//FRONTEND DEVELOPERS:
JSON server
DUMMY SERVER //NOT ACTUAL SERVER;

TO SEND AND GET DATA FROM DUMMY SERVER;
UI TESTINNG IS DONE BY THIS;

SEE THAT SERVER HAS TO BE RENDERED THEN IT COMES AS BACKEND SERVER TO THE UI DEVELOPER;

DO: npm(NODE PACKAGE MANAGER) 

JSON SERVER TO MANAGE A NODE PCKAGE MODULE;

ANY MODULE WIL BE DONE WITH NPM(NOd PAck MOdeule)


THIS IS ONE OF THE MODULE OF NODE>JS


npm install -g json-server

NOde comes with strict version ANY extra module: use NPM;

Let us say 10 project all use JSON servers; so -g is global for all projects; 



NODE IS PURE JS< SO PPL DID HELPER FILES

NPMJS website to find all your node modules;

json server is one of the module of node.js;

So, once your helper file is published you can take it and use it.

json server is one of the module;

pip is here called NPM;

json   

After success in installation:
localhost:3000/posts

Server has to be in listen MOde;
For locahosts to run;

Close CMD after changing Env Variables.
and then start again.

I am getting warning of depreciation;

URL:
http://localhost:3000
domain name and Port Number;
to mention as using customized port;

Wake up Server:
json-server --watch db.json

+ s to create a database for the json server;

db.json is in username folder chirag;

Has only 3 things:
Posts, Comments, Profile.

We dont change the db data as is the dummy server only;


What are the paths for JSON Server to be installed;
//It probably goes where node.js wants to install that package as doing from command prompt;

db.json is to be in same path as of Server(Json Server).

Json server is aa module of Node Package Manager.
Wat are other typeof Modules;



//JSON server wont insatall in a proxy;

dir used for direc in Windows;

Even for NPM there is a path to be set;

Ctrl+c to end the current Server;



We have hosted the rest coutry data on our server of NPM -JSONSERVER;

with db.json as database;

In postman 

In POST tag: we get an error, saying no ID field in our database;

Create one then;


Created a new property id: ss.id=i;

Now, in CMD comes 150 more kines, if WRITTEN In file this will not come;

const fs=require('fs');
let lyrics="Hello YIFUYFYUF";

fs.writeFile('abc.txt',lyrics,(err)=>{
	if(err) throw err;
	
	console.log('Lyric saved!');
});


Add property;	//done;
Node Module usage need to be done- using file system;	
                     //tried printing abc.txt from abc.txt,lyrics;


POST to be done from jsonserver- from postman

Object creation JS file is called JSON;


For the POstMan Server JSON Server must always be running;
If we are hitting our URL in the POSTMAN;


Creating Clone of Git Repo:
Open Git Bashthe terminal.

Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.

$ git clone https://hostname/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY


Git says heroku not present;
Also, JSon in File server see;


Browser has: View SRc Debugger, Response View;
Refresh to start Debugging in bpth Firefox and Chrome;

Response view is where you ge to see how the page will look like in different devices;

Is head body and HTML tag necessary in html??

Why someone has to introduce Header tag really?
Header, nav were intro in HTML% onwards;

<a></a> is tag name;
They have attributes to them;
eg anchor tag has href property;

Global: Class, ID, Hidden;
Other: attributes  as well check with attribute which tags imoplement them.


Href Links load one by one;
Defer new attribute element in script tag:
Go load Body and Head of HTML, I willl load the script of JS till then dont worry;

Know atlaest 10-15 attributes;

Use Absolute Path of the JS in Scri[t Tag only;
Realtive starts: ./
Absolute ./arun/script.js;

. means current folder;

div and section difference;

Why header Tag in HTML?
Diff div and section;

heroku git:remote -a yourapp //for heroku to get connected from local to remote;


Zen Class 4:
PASS Post as a service;

JS compares only the values,
Other languages cannot compare string and numbers;

Mostly in newer languages, they add on functionality to the language;

D Type
prim;
Composite or rest: Object all rest;//null and undefined as well;

Java, CPP: Map;
Here JSON is Map;
Function is also an object they say;	//they are first class objects;

Can pass a func to a function;

empty Room: null is an object;	//Do chceck against NUll in Java, CPP;

Do check against undefined in JS:
Vaccum Chamber : Undefined //not a value so not an object;

Share the same sheet: is call by Reference;
Share the same URL: is call by value;

All the objects in JavaScript are going to be compulsary Copy by Refernce;

Primitive TYpes memory less so will be copy by Value;

BUg Bounty 500;
Why are Objects copy by reference and Primitive are by COpy by Value;

Using Spraed OPerator can pass by value in Arrays as well;

Google Ads: Reads your cache from browwser there is JS program written by Google to read them;

Local Cache/storage is where passwords are stored;



Other sites cannot touch Loacal Storage of another Website;
Loacal Storage VS Cookies?

So, they also store cache in incognito;//Google people;

Even before DOM  we have Window Object;

JS when creating Array:
It creates an Object internally;

It creates void in Array;
Creates undefined;
in Void Spaces;

Also, if passing string it becomes a part of the object as a property of object for that array;
NO included in the actual length though;

Object.keys(arr)	//Shows all the Object values incl arr properties;

Object.keys(arr).length to get the actual object length;

arr["15"]=999;
15 string is converted to the index of the array and is not treated as a property;

JS does internal conversion of this number;

So, whenever you add (); that is when you arecalling the function body itself;

arr[4]=fn;//fn stored
arr[5]=fn()//fn calling arr[5]= undefined in this index;


arr[4]();//to print the functions of the array;

arr[4].fn()//see??

console.log(a.ttt)
Oject is not defined so what to print in console; so undefined;
consle.log(a.ttt.tt); exception as there is no value of uundefined ttt property;


if(a.ttt!=undefined){
console.log(a.ttt);//then print;
}


try{
consoole.log(a.ttt);
console.log(a.ttt.tt);
}
catch(ee){
	console.log(ee);
}
will give Typed Error and says a.ttt is undefined;

Stops abruptly in uncaught exception;
Stops and GIves error gracefully in the Caught Exception;


API: 
App1 Maps--DB of gooogle DataStore;

App needs my data;
you can do this by Code;

Standard API:
Given by Companies to be used;

Can use their API to create this stuff; of PDF;

By using Web API: rest Countries Data is what we are accessing by using API;

Method to touch the API, using JS using XML method;

AJAX: w/o reloading the entire page;



Hey, When needed only Client will ask, dont send anything from Server side;

load enter,
button submit;

Hey just give me element to refresh just the part of webpage;
JS has timer to initiate req and then get the data and then it modifies the DOM and gives the data;

No one used;

Used only for JS popup only;

Google used AJAX first time;
WHen typung anything in search box you will get the data, w/o entering/submitting.

XML not sent now, AJAX now.

Update only that part of div only based on timing and typing;

Synch: Ack =nowledge after sending everytime;
Value is pretty good;

Asynch: No wait for the person to acknowledge;
Value is questionable;

Coding World:
Disk read; asynch with handler;
Network; 
 
Defer tag of JS is asynch with handler;

AJAJ: really no XML;

every req has true false for asynch and synch thing;

JS: workout101: json101:
1html; 1 JSON;

Incl JSON in the HTML Page;

So, req, url str,

If false: Synchronous;
AJAX: True;

Also, with fetch doing;

CORS:
Cross Origin Resource Get:
* all access;
API KEY, only using Password;

Replacing the Browser URL, with the API; will make it to be AJAX API;
