Browser has: View SRc Debugger, Response View;
Refresh to start Debugging in bpth Firefox and Chrome;

Response view is where you ge to see how the page will look like in different devices;

Is head body and HTML tag necessary in html??

Why someone has to introduce Header tag really?
Header, nav were intro in HTML% onwards;

<a></a> is tag name;
They have attributes to them;
eg anchor tag has href property;

Global: Class, ID, Hidden;
Other: attributes  as well check with attribute which tags imoplement them.


Href Links load one by one;
Defer new attribute element in script tag:
Go load Body and Head of HTML, I willl load the script of JS till then dont worry;

Know atlaest 10-15 attributes;

Use Absolute Path of the JS in Scri[t Tag only;
Realtive starts: ./
Absolute ./arun/script.js;

. means current folder;

div and section difference;

Why header Tag in HTML?
Diff div and section;

Zen Class 4:
PASS Post as a service;

JS compares only the values,
Other languages cannot compare string and numbers;

Mostly in newer languages, they add on functionality to the language;

D Type
prim;
Composite or rest: Object all rest;//null and undefined as well;

Java, CPP: Map;
Here JSON is Map;
Function is also an object they say;	//they are first class objects;

Can pass a func to a function;

empty Room: null is an object;	//Do chceck against NUll in Java, CPP;

Do check against undefined in JS:
Vaccum Chamber : Undefined //not a value so not an object;

Share the same sheet: is call by Reference;
Share the same URL: is call by value;

All the objects in JavaScript are going to be compulsary Copy by Refernce;

Primitive TYpes memory less so will be copy by Value;

BUg Bounty 500;
Why are Objects copy by reference and Primitive are by COpy by Value;

Using Spraed OPerator can pass by value in Arrays as well;

Google Ads: Reads your cache from browwser there is JS program written by Google to read them;

Local Cache/storage is where passwords are stored;



Other sites cannot touch Loacal Storage of another Website;
Loacal Storage VS Cookies?

So, they also store cache in incognito;//Google people;

Even before DOM  we have Window Object;

JS when creating Array:
It creates an Object internally;

It creates void in Array;
Creates undefined;
in Void Spaces;

Also, if passing string it becomes a part of the object as a property of object for that array;
NO included in the actual length though;

Object.keys(arr)	//Shows all the Object values incl arr properties;

Object.keys(arr).length to get the actual object length;

arr["15"]=999;
15 string is converted to the index of the array and is not treated as a property;

JS does internal conversion of this number;

So, whenever you add (); that is when you arecalling the function body itself;

arr[4]=fn;//fn stored
arr[5]=fn()//fn calling arr[5]= undefined in this index;


arr[4]();//to print the functions of the array;

arr[4].fn()//see??

console.log(a.ttt)
Oject is not defined so what to print in console; so undefined;
consle.log(a.ttt.tt); exception as there is no value of uundefined ttt property;


if(a.ttt!=undefined){
console.log(a.ttt);//then print;
}


try{
consoole.log(a.ttt);
console.log(a.ttt.tt);
}
catch(ee){
	console.log(ee);
}
will give Typed Error and says a.ttt is undefined;

Stops abruptly in uncaught exception;
Stops and GIves error gracefully in the Caught Exception;


API: 
App1 Maps--DB of gooogle DataStore;

App needs my data;
you can do this by Code;

Standard API:
Given by Companies to be used;

Can use their API to create this stuff; of PDF;

By using Web API: rest Countries Data is what we are accessing by using API;

Method to touch the API, using JS using XML method;

AJAX: w/o reloading the entire page;



Hey, When needed only Client will ask, dont send anything from Server side;

load enter,
button submit;

Hey just give me element to refresh just the part of webpage;
JS has timer to initiate req and then get the data and then it modifies the DOM and gives the data;

No one used;

Used only for JS popup only;

Google used AJAX first time;
WHen typung anything in search box you will get the data, w/o entering/submitting.

XML not sent now, AJAX now.

Update only that part of div only based on timing and typing;

Synch: Ack =nowledge after sending everytime;
Value is pretty good;

Asynch: No wait for the person to acknowledge;
Value is questionable;

Coding World:
Disk read; asynch with handler;
Network; 
 
Defer tag of JS is asynch with handler;

AJAJ: really no XML;

every req has true false for asynch and synch thing;

JS: workout101: json101:
1html; 1 JSON;

Incl JSON in the HTML Page;

So, req, url str,

If false: Synchronous;
AJAX: True;

Also, with fetch doing;

CORS:
Cross Origin Resource Get:
* all access;
API KEY, only using Password;

Replacing the Browser URL, with the API; will make it to be AJAX API;

Read about CORS;

Is API Provider Side COntrol;

TAsk:
OPen API;
CORS;//See;

Fetch URL is new;
Request HTTP Stuff is old;

CHcek PPT for chcecking;
Questions;

RSET and SOAP difference;


FileSystem API as well the one we use to open and close file using Command Prompt;

Mostly now, APIs are what we touch using the web APIs;

Replace the actual Array with API;

Using HTTP Request;

From JS we have a timer from whic we can initiate the request;

AJAX is used with JavaScript;

Now all data taken and Back is using JSON;

Not using XML nowadays;

Cricket Score, Weather, and Google Search;

When openeing the URL:
GET, https://restcountries, true;

If true: Asynchronous;
Else,
Synchronous;

JSON Data is requested using the function():
JSON.parse(this.response);



NOw:
Write the HTTP Request:
To get the data ie use the API way;
RAther than copy pasting the Array itself to the file;

Creating the HTML request in the JS file:


And save the request URL in the url_string;

var req=new XMLHTTPRequest();
var url_string="https://getcountries.api";
req.open();
req.send();
req.onload=function(){
}


Hey so in console of the Browser(HTML File):
You have the the Array;
