Hey Note for the pointers in general:

Type of questionns to solve as of Now:
As many questions are solved for the DS,
More you will get comfortable with the type of questions coming in the exam;

Well, in most of the exams you can switch the tabs they dont come to know much about it;(-;



YOu can always take up pointers;

without using the loop to traverse see firstly if you do the operations using just one loop;

to compare, or to swap, can be done in the same loop;


Also, this can be done;
by i=0 and j decrementing wih j=size-1;
When is the need to go for 2 loops then?
