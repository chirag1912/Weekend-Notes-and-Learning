JS Basics:
Reach out to mentor will be having 10-15 people;
JS 101 for the prsentation in upcoming week;

Pirates of Silicon Valley;//Watch;

Sun MIcro and Netscape said so;
Can run on any system;
Written browser;
around 1994-96;

Bill killed NetScape; by creating Internet Explorer;

Browser Wars //Watch on Youtube;

Bill Gates CReated Jscript: is dead;
Java is almost Dead;

For android Java was primary language;

Sun acquired by Oracle and was said Java being used in Android;

Kotlin being used in Android now;

J2EE has only spring and Spring Boot taking Java Ahead;
Bootstrap is grandfather;

Would you say Python and JS will thrive forever, sir?
Till you get a cure;

WebAssembly: browsers have slowly sarted supporting them;
To support C++ as well;

Hey,
So FB and Google: are making frameworks of Javascript;


System Design will decide which framework to use;

HTML is like bone;

CSS is skin and Muscles;

JavaScript is like Life: MAkes the website Dynamic;
Makes INteractive;
Can be created in FE and Backend;

DOM is like representing an object: every aprt of the page;
Is inmemory representation of HTML DOC;
What benefit do we get from Tree:
Tracing becomes easy, and Accessing as well;

Parsing of the HTML document gets easier;

Tree Structure:
To get the output at end: n iteration;
gets faster with tree structure;

Representation gets easy in HTML that way:
B tree and B+ Tree;

Watch Browser Wars;
and Pirates of Silicon Valley;

The war of Coding Languages:
Is like religion,
Depends on the Ruler whio is trting to implement it in the IT Industry;
