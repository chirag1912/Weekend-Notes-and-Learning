Hey, so to create a repository and dir, we can create one using .md readme file then write something in it;

how to commit to the github directly?
Can do using gitclown;

git add, commit, push;

So, you can gitclown stuff of github reposit- with our local file;
and then if reach to the path in cmd and type gitstatus, any changes in any of the file will be shown;

git add "ppt/000 - Browser Internals=getting started.pptx"


git status to know which file needs to be commited and has been just added as of yet;
git commit -m "modified Browser pptx File"

then do, git push;
-m is a switch for adding a message using CMD;
Untracked files are those which havent been added to our github repo;

So, to give a complete path to cmd, use "" quotes that way any spaces in the folder name will be compensated;

git add . will add all the files;
git add *.js

for every folder to get inside it use forward slash to get insdie it.

also you can use it inside the quotes of the path;

git status gives which files are commited and which are not;
