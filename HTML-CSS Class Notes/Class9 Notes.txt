Why we need forms?
To collect the data from the user;

forms:
required,
placeholder,


id is primary key;

why do we have id and name as well?



Name for input only;
id is for all;
to do the operations it has to be with id;

<form>
        <label for="username">Username</label>
        <input type="text" value="venkat" placeholder="username" name="username" id="username">
        <br>
        <label for="user-email">
            email
        </label>
        <input type=" email" required placeholder="abc@mail.com" name="email" id="user-email">
        <br>
        <label for="phone">Mobile</label>
        <input type=" text" required placeholder="mobile number" name="mobile" id="phone">
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="click">
    </form>


name can be used in case of grouping elements;
The id cannot be uded for grouping;

label for is used for referencing to the input vaue of the attribute;

selected and disabled;

For selecting a state; value is used from dropdown;



So, in URL name goes not the id of the form;

without name the value won't be passed to the backend, will be there itself;
Need name with attr of form to pass the values;

Why we need name?? use to submit the form;

<form action="sample.html" onsubmit="sendData()">
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="first name" required>
        <br>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="email" required>
        <br>
        <input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

    <script>
        function sendData() {
            alert('Thank you..!!');
        }
    </script>
